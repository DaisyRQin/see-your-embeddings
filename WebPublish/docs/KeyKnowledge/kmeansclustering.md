# K-means Clustering

The objective of the **K-means Clustering algorithm** is to group similar data samples together and observing underlying data patterns. To achieve this goal, the algorithm tries to find a fixed number of \(k\) data clusters, where each cluster is a group of data samples share certain similarities.

To process the data, the K-means clustering algorithm starts with \(k\) randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids. 

One can refer to the [sklearn.cluster.KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) to learn how to use the algorithm in python.
